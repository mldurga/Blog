My journey into the technology world began quite late in my life. As a mechanical engineer, I never imagined that I would venture into a domain that was not mine. However, the allure of coding, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence eventually beckoned me towards this industry. Initially, I faced resistance and inadequacy because of my non-technical background, but I was determined to make a mark in this fast-evolving technological world.


Through self-education and endless hours of hard work, I began to acquire knowledge and skills in coding and data engineering. The internet and online tutorials helped me learn the basics of programming languages such as Python, SQL, and JavaScript. Slowly but surely, I gained more proficiency and started working on small projects to strengthen my skills further. And now, I find myself drawn to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud DevOps, and excited to delve deeper into these areas.


This blog is an attempt to share my journey and experiences as a self-taught programmer in a world that is transitioning rapidly towards technology. Here, I hope to share my knowledge and provide insights into the fascinating world of computer engineering, data analysis, and software development. It is my hope that my story will inspire others to embrace their passions and pursue their dreams, regardless of their initial educational background.
