I am working as Solution Architect in AVEVA (Schneider Electric). I am passionate about data, and deeplearning. I am introduced to deeplearning through fast.ai and have been poisoned by it completely and have started blogging here from then onwards. I hope, one day I will write a great technical paper and publish. 

I am also self-taught - thanks to the wonderful [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course.
