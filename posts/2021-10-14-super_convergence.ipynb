    "## Introduction\n",
    "Until publication of the papers [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf),[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf),[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07120.pdf) by Mr Leslie Smith, finding learning rate of neural networks training is largely a black art and often requires extensive practice and expertise to set good hyperparameters. Mr Smith's contribution greatly helped reserach community on overall understanding of the topology of loss function. Unlike typical Machine Learning papers, Smith's Papers are very much approachable and invaluable. I have tried to reproduce fastai source code of implementation of 1cycle policy inspired from Smith's papers."

    "##Learning rate (LR) and Weight updataion\n",
    "In neural networks training, loss function (simply distance between target value and predicted value) must be decreased with each iteration. SGD - stochastic gradient descent is the method to achieve the above stated goal. If you can observe the above twitter card, loss function topology will be more or less have same features. Identifying global minimum of that topology is the sole aim of any Machine learning practitioner. However, training gets trapped over local minima and model underperforms. This is where Smiths ideas catapulted training neural networks to the next level. \n",

Low LR can have effect of trapping at [saddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point) points and local minima, High LR can immediately be diverged and loss value increases greatly. Until Smith's papers, setting right LR has been a great challenge."

The large learning rates allows training to jump over the local minimas and will find a way to global minima in much less time. Cyclical nature of the learning rates enables training to first slowly converge then moves at faster speeds to traverse the valley and again slows the pace to finally converge to final accuracy level. \n",

    "### Momentum\n",
    "According to Leslie papers, Momentum is as important as learning rate for training the network. The value of momentum observed to be decreasing while learning rate value is increasing in a stepsize of 1cycle policy. Momentum is an attempt to maintain consistent direction of SGD (stochastic Gradient Direction). If we set momentum at 90%, it means we will take 90% of the previous direction and 10% of the new direction. Intuitiviely we can look at moomentum as a process of giving more weight to new gradients or directions to find flatter area. Leslie smith suggest to use momentum values between 0.85 and 0.95 for training purpose."
