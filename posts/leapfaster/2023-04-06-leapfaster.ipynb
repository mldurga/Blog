Suddenly it has given a mentor, advisor, apprentice and intern for various people at their convenience at various levels depends on their level of expertise in their corresponding fields.

It can be playing with chatGPT prompts at openAI [website](https://chat.openai.com/chat), installing various GPT extensions in [VScode](https://code-gpt-docs.vercel.app/), tinkering the opensource model cards in [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models), or just browsing twitter over the developments of GPT models and leveraging them to our advantage. One would be surprised to realise the productivity gains, value additios that one can be profited with. Recently, I witnessed my friend develop a static website from scratch using chatGPT. Despite having no prior knowledge or experience in development, He was able to create website ready for hosting within an hour of interacting with this new technical marvel."
